# Show Me the Numbers Program in Java

The purpose of this project is to create a small Java program that returns all the numbers from 1 to 'n', each on a new line.

## Overview

When given an integer input `n`, the program should return all numbers from 1 to `n` inclusively, where each number is on its own line.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or any text editor of your choice
- Git installed (for cloning and pushing to GitHub)

## Example Usages

```java
int n = 10;
```

#### Output

```
